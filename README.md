# Development challenge

Medcloud's challenge for the general development vacancy.

## Problem

We need a system with a local CRUD and database to manage a collection of patients, and in real-time, replicate the inserts/edits/deletes on a remote database.

## Spec

To develop the CRUD, you MUST use the web frameworks React and Redux.
In the cloud, you MUST use the AWS Free Tier for your database and REST API that you will use to interact with your local database.
Locally, you MUST use Docker to host your database and CRUD.

## Delivery

You MUST fork this repository to your own account and push you code to it. When you done, you must send a email to cv@medcloud.com.br with your curriculum, fork, DockerHub image and how many time you managed to complete the challenge.

Good luck! Any doubts, send a email to cv@medcloud.com.br.
